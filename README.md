Standard Chess Game
This is a standard game of chess, but it was designed with the intention of experimenting with the classic game.

FEATURES:
Play is undertaken by two human players who alternate turns between themselves.
Players may only move their own pieces to tiles using legal moves.  These moves are highlighted in green on the chessboard.
The White player (by default) always goes first.  The White player is at the bottom of the screen, the Black player at the top of the screen.
There is no concept of "check," "checkmate," and "stalemate."  Play continues until a king is captured.
Knighting a pawn is automatically set to knighting the pawn to a queen.
Castling is possible, but must be initiated by selecting the King.
En passant is not a current feature.

NOTE
A note on the images: Images are treated as such:  White (FFFFFF) is treated as transparent, and Black (000000) is treated as stand in for the player's color.  They are currently retrieved from the working directory (the Debug folder).
